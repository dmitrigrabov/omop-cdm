# **OMOP CDM v5.4**


This is the specification document for the OMOP Common Data Model,
v5.4. **This is the latest version of the OMOP CDM.** Each
table is represented with a high-level description and ETL conventions
that should be followed. This is continued with a discussion of each
field in each table, any conventions related to the field, and
constraints that should be followed (like primary key, foreign key,
etc). All tables should be instantiated in a CDM instance but do not
need to be populated. Similarly, fields that are not required should
exist in the CDM table but do not need to be populated. Should you have
questions please feel free to visit the [forums](https://forums.ohdsi.org/) or the [github issue](https://github.com/ohdsi/CommonDataModel/issues)
page. 

### Current Support for CDM v5.4


The table below details which OHDSI tools support CDM v5.4. There are
two levels of support: legacy support means that the tool supports all
tables and fields that were present in CDM v5.3 and feature support
indicates that the tool supports any new tables and fields in CDM v5.4
that were not present in CDM v5.3. A green check ✔️ indicates that the
support level for the listed tool is in place, has been tested, and
released. A warning sign ❗ indicates that the support level for the
listed tool has been initiated but has not yet been tested and released.
  


| **Tool** | **Description** | **Legacy Support** | **Feature Support** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CDM R package** | This package can be downloaded from [https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/). It functions to dynamically create the OMOP CDM documentation and DDL scripts to instantiate the CDM tables. | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| **Data Quality Dashboard** | This package can be downloaded from [https://github.com/OHDSI/DataQualityDashboard](https://github.com/OHDSI/DataQualityDashboard). It runs a set of > 3500 data quality checks against an OMOP CDM instance and is required to be run on all databases prior to participating in an OHDSI network research study. | ✔️ | ❗ |
| **Achilles** | This package can be downloaded from [https://github.com/OHDSI/Achilles](https://github.com/OHDSI/Achilles), performing a set of broad database characterizations against an OMOP CDM instance. | ✔️ | ❗ |
| **ARES** | This package can be downloaded from [https://github.com/OHDSI/Ares](https://github.com/OHDSI/Ares) and is designed to display the results from both the ACHILLES and DataQualityDashboard packages to support data quality and characterization research. | ✔️ | ❗ |
| **ATLAS** | ATLAS is an open source software tool for researchers to conduct scientific analyses on standardized observational data. [Demo](http://atlas-demo.ohdsi.org/) | ✔️ | ❗ |
| **Rabbit-In-A-Hat** | This package can be downloaded from [https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit](https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit) and is an application for interactive design of an ETL to the OMOP Common Data Model with the help of the the scan report generated by White Rabbit. | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| **Feature Extraction** | This package can be downloaded from [https://github.com/OHDSI/FeatureExtraction](https://github.com/OHDSI/FeatureExtraction). It is designed to generate features (covariates) for a cohort generated using the OMOP CDM. | ✔️ | ✔️* |
| **Cohort Diagnostics** | This package can be downloaded from [https://github.com/OHDSI/CohortDiagnostics](https://github.com/OHDSI/CohortDiagnostics) and is used to critically evaluate cohort phenotypes. | ✔️ | ❗ |

  
 * The **Feature Extraction** package supports all
relevant new features in CDM v5.4. For example, it was decided that,
from a methodological perspective, the EPISODE and EPISODE_EVENT tables
should not be included to define cohort covariates because the events
that make up episodes are already pulled in as potential covariates.

### person


**Table Description** 

This table serves as the central identity management for all Persons
in the database. It contains records that uniquely identify each person
or patient, and some demographic information. 

**User Guide** 

All records in this table are independent Persons. 

**ETL Conventions** 

All Persons in a database needs one record in this table, unless they
fail data quality requirements specified in the ETL. Persons with no
Events should have a record nonetheless. If more than one data source
contributes Events to the database, Persons must be reconciled, if
possible, across the sources to create one single record per Person. The
content of the BIRTH_DATETIME must be equivalent to the content of
BIRTH_DAY, BIRTH_MONTH and BIRTH_YEAR.  
  
For detailed conventions
for how to populate this table, please refer to the [THEMIS
repository](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/person.html). 

| CDM Field | User Guide | ETL Conventions | Datatype | Required | Primary Key | Foreign Key | FK Table | FK Domain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| person_id | It is assumed that every person with a different unique identifier is in fact a different person and should be treated independently. | Any person linkage that needs to occur to uniquely identify Persons ought to be done prior to writing this table. This identifier can be the original id from the source data provided if it is an integer, otherwise it can be an autogenerated number. | integer | Yes | Yes | No |  |  |
| gender_concept_id | This field is meant to capture the biological sex at birth of the Person. This field should not be used to study gender identity issues. | Use the gender or sex value present in the data under the assumption that it is the biological sex at birth. If the source data captures gender identity it should be stored in the [OBSERVATION](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#observation) table. [Accepted gender concepts](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Gender&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). Please refer to the [THEMIS repository](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/tag_gender_concept_id.html) for detailed conventions on how to populate this field. | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Gender |
| year_of_birth | Compute age using year_of_birth. | For data sources with date of birth, the year should be extracted. If no year of birth is available all the person’s data should be dropped from the CDM instance. For additional information on how to populate this field, please refer to the [THEMIS repository](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/tag_year_of_birth.html). | integer | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| month_of_birth |  | For data sources that provide the precise date of birth, the month should be extracted and stored in this field. | integer | No | No | No |  |  |
| day_of_birth |  | For data sources that provide the precise date of birth, the day should be extracted and stored in this field. | integer | No | No | No |  |  |
| birth_datetime |  | This field is not required but highly encouraged. For data sources that provide the precise datetime of birth, that value should be stored in this field. For more information on how to populate this field, please refer to the [THEMIS repository](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/person.html). | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| race_concept_id | This field captures race or ethnic background of the person. | Only use this field if you have information about race or ethnic background. The Vocabulary contains Concepts about the main races and ethnic backgrounds in a hierarchical system. Due to the imprecise nature of human races and ethnic backgrounds, this is not a perfect system. Mixed races are not supported. If a clear race or ethnic background cannot be established, use Concept_Id 0. [Accepted Race Concepts](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Race&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Race |
| ethnicity_concept_id | This field captures Ethnicity as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of the US Government: it distinguishes only between “Hispanic” and “Not Hispanic”. Races and ethnic backgrounds are not stored here. | Only use this field if you have US-based data and a source of this information. Do not attempt to infer Ethnicity from the race or ethnic background of the Person. [Accepted ethnicity concepts](http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Ethnicity&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=) | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Ethnicity |
| location_id | The location refers to the physical address of the person. This field should capture the last known location of the person. | Put the location_id from the [LOCATION](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#location) table here that represents the most granular location information for the person. For additional information on how to populate this field, please refer to the [THEMIS repository](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/populate_person_location_id.html). | integer | No | No | Yes | LOCATION |  |
| provider_id | The Provider refers to the last known primary care provider (General Practitioner). | Put the provider_id from the [PROVIDER](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#provider) table of the last known general practitioner of the person. If there are multiple providers, it is up to the ETL to decide which to put here. | integer | No | No | Yes | PROVIDER |  |
| care_site_id | The Care Site refers to where the Provider typically provides the primary care. |  | integer | No | No | Yes | CARE_SITE |  |
| person_source_value | Use this field to link back to persons in the source data. This is typically used for error checking of ETL logic. | Some use cases require the ability to link back to persons in the source data. This field allows for the storing of the person value as it appears in the source. This field is not required but strongly recommended. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| gender_source_value | This field is used to store the biological sex of the person from the source data. It is not intended for use in standard analytics but for reference only. | Put the assigned sex at birth of the person as it appears in the source data. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| gender_source_concept_id | Due to the small number of options, this tends to be zero. | If the source data codes assigned sex at birth in a non-standard vocabulary, store the concept_id here. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| race_source_value | This field is used to store the race of the person from the source data. It is not intended for use in standard analytics but for reference only. | Put the race of the person as it appears in the source data. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| race_source_concept_id | Due to the small number of options, this tends to be zero. | If the source data codes race in an OMOP supported vocabulary store the concept_id here. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| ethnicity_source_value | This field is used to store the ethnicity of the person from the source data. It is not intended for use in standard analytics but for reference only. | If the person has an ethnicity other than the OMB standard of “Hispanic” or “Not Hispanic” store that value from the source data here. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| ethnicity_source_concept_id | Due to the small number of options, this tends to be zero. | If the source data codes ethnicity in an OMOP supported vocabulary, store the concept_id here. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |

### observation_period


**Table Description** 

This table contains records which define spans of time during which
two conditions are expected to hold: (i) Clinical Events that happened
to the Person are recorded in the Event tables, and (ii) absence of
records indicate such Events did not occur during this span of time. 

**User Guide** 

For each Person, one or more OBSERVATION_PERIOD records may be
present, but they will not overlap or be back to back to each other.
Events may exist outside all of the time spans of the OBSERVATION_PERIOD
records for a patient, however, absence of an Event outside these time
spans cannot be construed as evidence of absence of an Event. Incidence
or prevalence rates should only be calculated for the time of active
OBSERVATION_PERIOD records. When constructing cohorts, outside Events
can be used for inclusion criteria definition, but without any guarantee
for the performance of these criteria. Also, OBSERVATION_PERIOD records
can be as short as a single day, greatly disturbing the denominator of
any rate calculation as part of cohort characterizations. To avoid that,
apply minimal observation time as a requirement for any cohort
definition. 

**ETL Conventions** 

Each Person needs to have at least one OBSERVATION_PERIOD record,
which should represent time intervals with a high capture rate of
Clinical Events. Some source data have very similar concepts, such as
enrollment periods in insurance claims data. In other source data such
as most EHR systems these time spans need to be inferred under a set of
assumptions. It is the discretion of the ETL developer to define these
assumptions. In many ETL solutions the start date of the first
occurrence or the first high quality occurrence of a Clinical Event
(Condition, Drug, Procedure, Device, Measurement, Visit) is defined as
the start of the OBSERVATION_PERIOD record, and the end date of the last
occurrence of last high quality occurrence of a Clinical Event, or the
end of the database period becomes the end of the OBSERVATION_PERIOD for
each Person. If a Person only has a single Clinical Event the
OBSERVATION_PERIOD record can be as short as one day. Depending on these
definitions it is possible that Clinical Events fall outside the time
spans defined by OBSERVATION_PERIOD records. Family history or history
of Clinical Events generally are not used to generate OBSERVATION_PERIOD
records around the time they are referring to. Any two overlapping or
adjacent OBSERVATION_PERIOD records have to be merged into one. 

| CDM Field | User Guide | ETL Conventions | Datatype | Required | Primary Key | Foreign Key | FK Table | FK Domain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| observation_period_id | A Person can have multiple discrete Observation Periods which are identified by the Observation_Period_Id. | Assign a unique observation_period_id to each discrete Observation Period for a Person. | integer | Yes | Yes | No |  |  |
| person_id | The Person ID of the PERSON record for which the Observation Period is recorded. |  | integer | Yes | No | Yes | PERSON |  |
| observation_period_start_date | Use this date to determine the start date of the Observation Period. | It is often the case that the idea of Observation Periods does not exist in source data. In those cases, the observation_period_start_date can be inferred as the earliest Event date available for the Person. In insurance claim data, the Observation Period can be considered as the time period the Person is enrolled with a payer. If a Person switches plans but stays with the same payer, and therefore capturing of data continues, that change would be captured in [PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#payer_plan_period). | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| observation_period_end_date | Use this date to determine the end date of the period for which we can assume that all events for a Person are recorded. | It is often the case that the idea of Observation Periods does not exist in source data. In those cases, the observation_period_end_date can be inferred as the last Event date available for the Person. In insurance claim data, the Observation Period can be considered as the time period the Person is enrolled with a payer. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| period_type_concept_id | This field can be used to determine the provenance of the Observation Period as in whether the period was determined from an insurance enrollment file, EHR healthcare encounters, or other sources. | Choose the observation_period_type_concept_id that best represents how the period was determined. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Type+Concept&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). A more detailed explanation of each Type Concept can be found on the [vocabulary wiki](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/Vocab.-TYPE_CONCEPT). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Type Concept |

### visit_occurrence


**Table Description** 

This table contains Events where Persons engage with the healthcare
system for a duration of time. They are often also called “Encounters”.
Visits are defined by a configuration of circumstances under which they
occur, such as (i) whether the patient comes to a healthcare
institution, the other way around, or the interaction is remote, (ii)
whether and what kind of trained medical staff is delivering the service
during the Visit, and (iii) whether the Visit is transient or for a
longer period involving a stay in bed. 

**User Guide** 

The configuration defining the Visit are described by Concepts in the
Visit Domain, which form a hierarchical structure, but rolling up to
generally familiar Visits adopted in most healthcare systems
worldwide: 
- [Inpatient
Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9201): Person visiting hospital, at a Care Site, in bed, for
duration of more than one day, with physicians and other Providers
permanently available to deliver service around the clock
- [Emergency
Room Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9203): Person visiting dedicated healthcare institution for
treating emergencies, at a Care Site, within one day, with physicians
and Providers permanently available to deliver service around the
clock
- [Emergency
Room and Inpatient Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/262): Person visiting ER followed by a
subsequent Inpatient Visit, where Emergency department is part of
hospital, and transition from the ER to other hospital departments is
undefined
- [Non-hospital
institution Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/42898160): Person visiting dedicated institution for reasons
of poor health, at a Care Site, long-term or permanently, with no
physician but possibly other Providers permanently available to deliver
service around the clock
- [Outpatient
Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9202): Person visiting dedicated ambulatory healthcare institution,
at a Care Site, within one day, without bed, with physicians or medical
Providers delivering service during Visit
- [Home
Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/581476): Provider visiting Person, without a Care Site, within one
day, delivering service
- [Telehealth
Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/5083): Patient engages with Provider through communication
media
- [Pharmacy
Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/581458): Person visiting pharmacy for dispensing of Drug, at a Care
Site, within one day
- [Laboratory
Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/32036): Patient visiting dedicated institution, at a Care Site,
within one day, for the purpose of a Measurement.
- [Ambulance
Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/581478): Person using transportation service for the purpose of
initiating one of the other Visits, without a Care Site, within one day,
potentially with Providers accompanying the Visit and delivering
service
- [Case
Management Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/38004193): Person interacting with healthcare system, without
a Care Site, within a day, with no Providers involved, for
administrative purposes

The Visit duration, or ‘length of stay’, is defined as VISIT_END_DATE
- VISIT_START_DATE. For all Visits this is <1 day, except Inpatient
Visits and Non-hospital institution Visits. The CDM also contains the
VISIT_DETAIL table where additional information about the Visit is
stored, for example, transfers between units during an inpatient
Visit. 

**ETL Conventions** 

Visits can be derived easily if the source data contain coding
systems for Place of Service or Procedures, like CPT codes for well
visits. In those cases, the codes can be looked up and mapped to a
Standard Visit Concept. Otherwise, Visit Concepts have to be identified
in the ETL process. This table will contain concepts in the Visit
domain. These concepts are arranged in a hierarchical structure to
facilitate cohort definitions by rolling up to generally familiar Visits
adopted in most healthcare systems worldwide. Visits can be adjacent to
each other, i.e. the end date of one can be identical with the start
date of the other. As a consequence, more than one-day Visits or their
descendants can be recorded for the same day. Multi-day visits must not
overlap, i.e. share days other than start and end days. It is often the
case that some logic should be written for how to define visits and how
to assign Visit_Concept_Id. For example, in US claims outpatient visits
that appear to occur within the time period of an inpatient visit can be
rolled into one with the same Visit_Occurrence_Id. In EHR data inpatient
visits that are within one day of each other may be strung together to
create one visit. It will all depend on the source data and how
encounter records should be translated to visit occurrences. Providers
can be associated with a Visit through the PROVIDER_ID field, or
indirectly through PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE records linked both to the VISIT
and PROVIDER tables. 

| CDM Field | User Guide | ETL Conventions | Datatype | Required | Primary Key | Foreign Key | FK Table | FK Domain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| visit_occurrence_id | Use this to identify unique interactions between a person and the health care system. This identifier links across the other CDM event tables to associate events with a visit. | This should be populated by creating a unique identifier for each unique interaction between a person and the healthcare system where the person receives a medical good or service over a span of time. | integer | Yes | Yes | No |  |  |
| person_id |  |  | integer | Yes | No | Yes | PERSON |  |
| visit_concept_id | This field contains a concept id representing the kind of visit, like inpatient or outpatient. All concepts in this field should be standard and belong to the Visit domain. | Populate this field based on the kind of visit that took place for the person. For example this could be “Inpatient Visit”, “Outpatient Visit”, “Ambulatory Visit”, etc. This table will contain standard concepts in the Visit domain. These concepts are arranged in a hierarchical structure to facilitate cohort definitions by rolling up to generally familiar Visits adopted in most healthcare systems worldwide. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Visit&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Visit |
| visit_start_date | For inpatient visits, the start date is typically the admission date. For outpatient visits the start date and end date will be the same. | When populating VISIT_START_DATE, you should think about the patient experience to make decisions on how to define visits. In the case of an inpatient visit this should be the date the patient was admitted to the hospital or institution. In all other cases this should be the date of the patient-provider interaction. If this information is not available the record should be dropped. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| visit_start_datetime |  | If no time is given for the start date of a visit, set it to midnight (00:00:0000). | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| visit_end_date | For inpatient visits the end date is typically the discharge date. If a Person is still an inpatient in the hospital at the time of the data extract and does not have a visit_end_date, then set the visit_end_date to the date of the data pull. | Visit end dates are mandatory. If end dates are not provided in the source there are three ways in which to derive them: - Outpatient Visit: visit_end_datetime = visit_start_datetime - Emergency Room Visit: visit_end_datetime = visit_start_datetime - Inpatient Visit: Usually there is information about discharge. If not, you should be able to derive the end date from the sudden decline of activity or from the absence of inpatient procedures/drugs. - Non-hospital institution Visits: Particularly for claims data, if end dates are not provided assume the visit is for the duration of month that it occurs. For Inpatient Visits ongoing at the date of ETL, put date of processing the data into visit_end_datetime and visit_type_concept_id with 32220 “Still patient” to identify the visit as incomplete. - All other Visits: visit_end_datetime = visit_start_datetime. If this is a one-day visit the end date should match the start date. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| visit_end_datetime | If a Person is still an inpatient in the hospital at the time of the data extract and does not have a visit_end_datetime, then set the visit_end_datetime to the datetime of the data pull. | If no time is given for the end date of a visit, set it to midnight (00:00:0000). | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| visit_type_concept_id | Use this field to understand the provenance of the visit record, or where the record comes from. | Populate this field based on the provenance of the visit record, as in whether it came from an EHR record or billing claim. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Type+Concept&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). A more detailed explanation of each Type Concept can be found on the [vocabulary wiki](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/Vocab.-TYPE_CONCEPT). | Integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Type Concept |
| provider_id | There will only be one provider per visit record and the ETL document should clearly state how they were chosen (attending, admitting, etc.). If there are multiple providers associated with a visit in the source, this can be reflected in the event tables (CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, etc.) or in the VISIT_DETAIL table. | If there are multiple providers associated with a visit, you will need to choose which one to put here. The additional providers can be stored in the [VISIT_DETAIL](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#visit_detail) table. | integer | No | No | Yes | PROVIDER |  |
| care_site_id | This field provides information about the Care Site where the Visit took place. | There should only be one Care Site associated with a Visit. | integer | No | No | Yes | CARE_SITE |  |
| visit_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the kind of visit that took place (inpatient, outpatient, emergency, etc.) | If there is information about the kind of visit in the source data that value should be stored here. If a visit is an amalgamation of visits from the source then use a hierarchy to choose the visit source value, such as IP -> ER-> OP. This should line up with the logic chosen to determine how visits are created. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| visit_source_concept_id |  | If the visit source value is coded in the source data using an OMOP supported vocabulary put the concept id representing the source value here. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| admitted_from_concept_id | Use this field to determine where the patient was admitted from. This concept is part of the visit domain and can indicate if a patient was admitted to the hospital from a long-term care facility, for example. | If available, map the admitted_from_source_value to a standard concept in the visit domain. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Visit&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). If a person was admitted from home or was self-referred, set this to 0. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Visit |
| admitted_from_source_value |  | This information may be called something different in the source data but the field is meant to contain a value indicating where a person was admitted from. Typically this applies only to visits that have a length of stay, like inpatient visits or long-term care visits. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| discharged_to_concept_id | Use this field to determine where the patient was discharged to after a visit. This concept is part of the visit domain and can indicate if a patient was transferred to another hospital or sent to a long-term care facility, for example. It is assumed that a person is discharged to home therefore there is not a standard concept id for “home”. Use concept id = 0 when a person is discharged to home. | If available, map the discharged_to_source_value to a standard concept in the visit domain. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Visit&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Visit |
| discharged_to_source_value |  | This information may be called something different in the source data but the field is meant to contain a value indicating where a person was discharged to after a visit, as in they went home or were moved to long-term care. Typically this applies only to visits that have a length of stay of a day or more. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| preceding_visit_occurrence_id | Use this field to find the visit that occurred for the person prior to the given visit. There could be a few days or a few years in between. | This field can be used to link a visit immediately preceding the current visit. Note this is not symmetrical, and there is no such thing as a “following_visit_id”. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_OCCURRENCE |  |

### visit_detail


**Table Description** 

The VISIT_DETAIL table is an optional table used to represents
details of each record in the parent VISIT_OCCURRENCE table. A good
example of this would be the movement between units in a hospital during
an inpatient stay or claim lines associated with a one insurance claim.
For every record in the VISIT_OCCURRENCE table there may be 0 or more
records in the VISIT_DETAIL table with a 1:n relationship where n may be
0. The VISIT_DETAIL table is structurally very similar to
VISIT_OCCURRENCE table and belongs to the visit domain. 

**User Guide** 

The configuration defining the Visit Detail is described by Concepts
in the Visit Domain, which form a hierarchical structure. The Visit
Detail record will have an associated to the Visit Occurrence record in
two ways:   
 1. The Visit Detail record will have the
VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID it is associated to 2. The VISIT_DETAIL_CONCEPT_ID
will be a descendant of the VISIT_CONCEPT_ID for the Visit. 

**ETL Conventions** 

It is not mandatory that the VISIT_DETAIL table be filled in, but if
you find that the logic to create VISIT_OCCURRENCE records includes the
roll-up of multiple smaller records to create one picture of a Visit
then it is a good idea to use VISIT_DETAIL. In EHR data, for example, a
Person may be in the hospital but instead of one over-arching Visit
their encounters are recorded as times they interacted with a health
care provider. A Person in the hospital interacts with multiple
providers multiple times a day so the encounters must be strung together
using some heuristic (defined by the ETL) to identify the entire Visit.
In this case the encounters would be considered Visit Details and the
entire Visit would be the Visit Occurrence. In this example it is also
possible to use the Vocabulary to distinguish Visit Details from a Visit
Occurrence by setting the VISIT_CONCEPT_ID to [9201](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9201) and the
VISIT_DETAIL_CONCEPT_IDs either to 9201 or its children to indicate
where the patient was in the hospital at the time of care.

| visit_detail_id | Use this to identify unique interactions between a person and the health care system. This identifier links across the other CDM event tables to associate events with a visit detail. | This should be populated by creating a unique identifier for each unique interaction between a person and the healthcare system where the person receives a medical good or service over a span of time. | integer | Yes | Yes | No |  |  |
| person_id |  |  | integer | Yes | No | Yes | PERSON |  |
| visit_detail_concept_id | This field contains a concept id representing the kind of visit detail, like inpatient or outpatient. All concepts in this field should be standard and belong to the Visit domain. | Populate this field based on the kind of visit that took place for the person. For example this could be “Inpatient Visit”, “Outpatient Visit”, “Ambulatory Visit”, etc. This table will contain standard concepts in the Visit domain. These concepts are arranged in a hierarchical structure to facilitate cohort definitions by rolling up to generally familiar Visits adopted in most healthcare systems worldwide. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Visit&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Visit |
| visit_detail_start_date | This is the date of the start of the encounter. This may or may not be equal to the date of the Visit the Visit Detail is associated with. | When populating VISIT_DETAIL_START_DATE, you should think about the patient experience to make decisions on how to define visits. Most likely this should be the date of the patient-provider interaction. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| visit_detail_start_datetime |  | If no time is given for the start date of a visit, set it to midnight (00:00:0000). | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| visit_detail_end_date | This the end date of the patient-provider interaction. If a Person is still an inpatient in the hospital at the time of the data extract and does not have a visit_end_date, then set the visit_end_date to the date of the data pull. | Visit Detail end dates are mandatory. If end dates are not provided in the source there are three ways in which to derive them: - Outpatient Visit Detail: visit_detail_end_datetime = visit_detail_start_datetime - Emergency Room Visit Detail: visit_detail_end_datetime = visit_detail_start_datetime - Inpatient Visit Detail: Usually there is information about discharge. If not, you should be able to derive the end date from the sudden decline of activity or from the absence of inpatient procedures/drugs. - Non-hospital institution Visit Details: Particularly for claims data, if end dates are not provided assume the visit is for the duration of month that it occurs. For Inpatient Visit Details ongoing at the date of ETL, put date of processing the data into visit_detai_end_datetime and visit_detail_type_concept_id with 32220 “Still patient” to identify the visit as incomplete. All other Visits Details: visit_detail_end_datetime = visit_detail_start_datetime. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| visit_detail_end_datetime | If a Person is still an inpatient in the hospital at the time of the data extract and does not have a visit_end_datetime, then set the visit_end_datetime to the datetime of the data pull. | If no time is given for the end date of a visit, set it to midnight (00:00:0000). | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| visit_detail_type_concept_id | Use this field to understand the provenance of the visit detail record, or where the record comes from. | Populate this field based on the provenance of the visit detail record, as in whether it came from an EHR record or billing claim.

| provider_id | There will only be one provider per **visit** record and the ETL document should clearly state how they were chosen (attending, admitting, etc.). This is a typical reason for leveraging the VISIT_DETAIL table as even though each VISIT_DETAIL record can only have one provider, there is no limit to the number of VISIT_DETAIL records that can be associated to a VISIT_OCCURRENCE record. | The additional providers associated to a Visit can be stored in this table where each VISIT_DETAIL record represents a different provider. | integer | No | No | Yes | PROVIDER |  |
| care_site_id | This field provides information about the Care Site where the Visit Detail took place. | There should only be one Care Site associated with a Visit Detail. | integer | No | No | Yes | CARE_SITE |  |
| visit_detail_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the kind of visit detail that took place (inpatient, outpatient, emergency, etc.) | If there is information about the kind of visit detail in the source data that value should be stored here. If a visit is an amalgamation of visits from the source then use a hierarchy to choose the VISIT_DETAIL_SOURCE_VALUE, such as IP -> ER-> OP. This should line up with the logic chosen to determine how visits are created. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| visit_detail_source_concept_id |  | If the VISIT_DETAIL_SOURCE_VALUE is coded in the source data using an OMOP supported vocabulary put the concept id representing the source value here. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| admitted_from_concept_id | Use this field to determine where the patient was admitted from. This concept is part of the visit domain and can indicate if a patient was admitted to the hospital from a long-term care facility, for example. | If available, map the admitted_from_source_value to a standard concept in the visit domain. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Visit&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=).

| discharged_to_concept_id | Use this field to determine where the patient was discharged to after a visit. This concept is part of the visit domain and can indicate if a patient was transferred to another hospital or sent to a long-term care facility, for example. It is assumed that a person is discharged to home therefore there is not a standard concept id for “home”. Use concept id = 0 when a person is discharged to home. | If available, map the DISCHARGE_TO_SOURCE_VALUE to a Standard Concept in the Visit domain.

| preceding_visit_detail_id | Use this field to find the visit detail that occurred for the person prior to the given visit detail record. There could be a few days or a few years in between. | The PRECEDING_VISIT_DETAIL_ID can be used to link a visit immediately preceding the current Visit Detail. Note this is not symmetrical, and there is no such thing as a “following_visit_id”. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_DETAIL |  |
| parent_visit_detail_id | Use this field to find the visit detail that subsumes the given visit detail record. This is used in the case that a visit detail record needs to be nested beyond the VISIT_OCCURRENCE/VISIT_DETAIL relationship. | If there are multiple nested levels to how Visits are represented in the source, the VISIT_DETAIL_PARENT_ID can be used to record this relationship. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_DETAIL |  |

### condition_occurrence


**Table Description** 

This table contains records of Events of a Person suggesting the
presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a
sign, or a symptom, which is either observed by a Provider or reported
by the patient. 

**User Guide** 

Conditions are defined by Concepts from the Condition domain, which
form a complex hierarchy. As a result, the same Person with the same
disease may have multiple Condition records, which belong to the same
hierarchical family. Most Condition records are mapped from diagnostic
codes, but recorded signs, symptoms and summary descriptions also
contribute to this table. Rule out diagnoses should not be recorded in
this table, but in reality their negating nature is not always captured
in the source data, and other precautions must be taken when when
identifying Persons who should suffer from the recorded Condition.
Record all conditions as they exist in the source data. Any decisions
about diagnosis/phenotype definitions would be done through cohort
specifications. These cohorts can be housed in the [COHORT](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#payer_plan_period)
table. Conditions span a time interval from start to end, but are
typically recorded as single snapshot records with no end date. The
reason is twofold: (i) At the time of the recording the duration is not
known and later not recorded, and (ii) the Persons typically cease
interacting with the healthcare system when they feel better, which
leads to incomplete capture of resolved Conditions. The [CONDITION_ERA](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#condition_era)
table addresses this issue. Family history and past diagnoses (‘history
of’) are not recorded in this table. Instead, they are listed in the [OBSERVATION](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#observation)
table. Codes written in the process of establishing the diagnosis, such
as ‘question of’ of and ‘rule out’, should not represented here.
Instead, they should be recorded in the [OBSERVATION](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#observation)
table, if they are used for analyses. However, this information is not
always available. 

**ETL Conventions** 

Source codes and source text fields mapped to Standard Concepts of
the Condition Domain have to be recorded here. 

| CDM Field | User Guide | ETL Conventions | Datatype | Required | Primary Key | Foreign Key | FK Table | FK Domain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| condition_occurrence_id | The unique key given to a condition record for a person. Refer to the ETL for how duplicate conditions during the same visit were handled. | Each instance of a condition present in the source data should be assigned this unique key. In some cases, a person can have multiple records of the same condition within the same visit. It is valid to keep these duplicates and assign them individual, unique, CONDITION_OCCURRENCE_IDs, though it is up to the ETL how they should be handled. | integer | Yes | Yes | No |  |  |
| person_id | The PERSON_ID of the PERSON for whom the condition is recorded. |  | integer | Yes | No | Yes | PERSON |  |
| condition_concept_id | The CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID field is recommended for primary use in analyses, and must be used for network studies. This is the standard concept mapped from the source value which represents a condition | The CONCEPT_ID that the CONDITION_SOURCE_VALUE maps to. Only records whose source values map to concepts with a domain of “Condition” should go in this table. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Condition&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Condition |
| condition_start_date | Use this date to determine the start date of the condition | Most often data sources do not have the idea of a start date for a condition. Rather, if a source only has one date associated with a condition record it is acceptable to use that date for both the CONDITION_START_DATE and the CONDITION_END_DATE. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| condition_start_datetime |  | If a source does not specify datetime the convention is to set the time to midnight (00:00:0000) | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| condition_end_date | Use this date to determine the end date of the condition | Most often data sources do not have the idea of a start date for a condition. Rather, if a source only has one date associated with a condition record it is acceptable to use that date for both the CONDITION_START_DATE and the CONDITION_END_DATE. | date | No | No | No |  |  |
| condition_end_datetime |  | If a source does not specify datetime the convention is to set the time to midnight (00:00:0000) | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| condition_type_concept_id | This field can be used to determine the provenance of the Condition record, as in whether the condition was from an EHR system, insurance claim, registry, or other sources. | Choose the CONDITION_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID that best represents the provenance of the record.

| condition_status_concept_id | This concept represents the point during the visit the diagnosis was given (admitting diagnosis, final diagnosis), whether the diagnosis was determined due to laboratory findings, if the diagnosis was exclusionary, or if it was a preliminary diagnosis, among others. | Choose the Concept in the Condition Status domain that best represents the point during the visit when the diagnosis was given. These can include admitting diagnosis, principal diagnosis, and secondary diagnosis. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Condition+Status&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Condition Status |
| stop_reason | The Stop Reason indicates why a Condition is no longer valid with respect to the purpose within the source data. Note that a Stop Reason does not necessarily imply that the condition is no longer occurring. | This information is often not populated in source data and it is a valid etl choice to leave it blank if the information does not exist. | varchar(20) | No | No | No |  |  |
| provider_id | The provider associated with condition record, e.g. the provider who made the diagnosis or the provider who recorded the symptom. | The ETL may need to make a choice as to which PROVIDER_ID to put here. Based on what is available this may or may not be different than the provider associated with the overall VISIT_OCCURRENCE record, for example the admitting vs attending physician on an EHR record. | integer | No | No | Yes | PROVIDER |  |
| visit_occurrence_id | The visit during which the condition occurred. | Depending on the structure of the source data, this may have to be determined based on dates. If a CONDITION_START_DATE occurs within the start and end date of a Visit it is a valid ETL choice to choose the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID from the Visit that subsumes it, even if not explicitly stated in the data. While not required, an attempt should be made to locate the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID of the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE record. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_OCCURRENCE |  |
| visit_detail_id | The VISIT_DETAIL record during which the condition occurred. For example, if the person was in the ICU at the time of the diagnosis the VISIT_OCCURRENCE record would reflect the overall hospital stay and the VISIT_DETAIL record would reflect the ICU stay during the hospital visit. | Same rules apply as for the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_DETAIL |  |
| condition_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the condition that occurred. For example, this could be an ICD10 or Read code. | This code is mapped to a Standard Condition Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is stored here for reference. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| condition_source_concept_id | This is the concept representing the condition source value and may not necessarily be standard. This field is discouraged from use in analysis because it is not required to contain Standard Concepts that are used across the OHDSI community, and should only be used when Standard Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for the Condition necessary for a given analytic use case. Consider using CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID instead to enable standardized analytics that can be consistent across the network. | If the CONDITION_SOURCE_VALUE is coded in the source data using an OMOP supported vocabulary put the concept id representing the source value here. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| condition_status_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the condition status. | This information may be called something different in the source data but the field is meant to contain a value indicating when and how a diagnosis was given to a patient. This source value is mapped to a standard concept which is stored in the CONDITION_STATUS_CONCEPT_ID field. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |

### drug_exposure


**Table Description** 

This table captures records about the exposure to a Drug ingested or
otherwise introduced into the body. A Drug is a biochemical substance
formulated in such a way that when administered to a Person it will
exert a certain biochemical effect on the metabolism. Drugs include
prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and
large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or
applied locally do not count as Drugs. 

**User Guide** 

The purpose of records in this table is to indicate an exposure to a
certain drug as best as possible. In this context a drug is defined as
an active ingredient. Drug Exposures are defined by Concepts from the
Drug domain, which form a complex hierarchy. As a result, one
DRUG_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID may map to multiple standard concept ids if it is
a combination product. Records in this table represent prescriptions
written, prescriptions dispensed, and drugs administered by a provider
to name a few. The DRUG_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID can be used to find and filter
on these types. This table includes additional information about the
drug products, the quantity given, and route of administration. 

**ETL Conventions** 

Information about quantity and dose is provided in a variety of
different ways and it is important for the ETL to provide as much
information as possible from the data. Depending on the provenance of
the data fields may be captured differently i.e. quantity for drugs
administered may have a separate meaning from quantity for prescriptions
dispensed. If a patient has multiple records on the same day for the
same drug or procedures the ETL should not de-dupe them unless there is
probable reason to believe the item is a true data duplicate. Take note
on how to handle refills for prescriptions written.  
  
For detailed
conventions on how to populate this table, please refer to the [THEMIS
repository](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/drug_exposure.html). 

| CDM Field | User Guide | ETL Conventions | Datatype | Required | Primary Key | Foreign Key | FK Table | FK Domain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| drug_exposure_id | The unique key given to records of drug dispensings or administrations for a person. Refer to the ETL for how duplicate drugs during the same visit were handled. | Each instance of a drug dispensing or administration present in the source data should be assigned this unique key. In some cases, a person can have multiple records of the same drug within the same visit. It is valid to keep these duplicates and assign them individual, unique, DRUG_EXPOSURE_IDs, though it is up to the ETL how they should be handled. | integer | Yes | Yes | No |  |  |
| person_id | The PERSON_ID of the PERSON for whom the drug dispensing or administration is recorded. This may be a system generated code. |  | integer | Yes | No | Yes | PERSON |  |
| drug_concept_id | The DRUG_CONCEPT_ID field is recommended for primary use in analyses, and must be used for network studies. This is the standard concept mapped from the source concept id which represents a drug product or molecule otherwise introduced to the body. The drug concepts can have a varying degree of information about drug strength and dose. This information is relevant in the context of quantity and administration information in the subsequent fields plus strength information from the DRUG_STRENGTH table, provided as part of the standard vocabulary download. | The CONCEPT_ID that the DRUG_SOURCE_VALUE maps to. The concept id should be derived either from mapping from the source concept id or by picking the drug concept representing the most amount of detail you have. Records whose source values map to standard concepts with a domain of Drug should go in this table. When the Drug Source Value of the code cannot be translated into Standard Drug Concept IDs, a Drug exposure entry is stored with only the corresponding SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID and DRUG_SOURCE_VALUE and a DRUG_CONCEPT_ID of 0. The Drug Concept with the most detailed content of information is preferred during the mapping process. These are indicated in the CONCEPT_CLASS_ID field of the Concept and are recorded in the following order of precedence: Marketed Product, Branded Pack, Clinical Pack, Branded Drug, Clinical Drug, Branded Drug Component, Clinical Drug Component, Branded Drug Form, Clinical Drug Form, and only if no other information is available Ingredient. Note: If only the drug class is known, the DRUG_CONCEPT_ID field should contain 0. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Drug&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Drug |
| drug_exposure_start_date | Use this date to determine the start date of the drug record. | Valid entries include a start date of a prescription, the date a prescription was filled, or the date on which a Drug administration was recorded. It is a valid ETL choice to use the date the drug was ordered as the DRUG_EXPOSURE_START_DATE. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| drug_exposure_start_datetime |  | This is not required, though it is in v6. If a source does not specify datetime the convention is to set the time to midnight (00:00:0000) | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| drug_exposure_end_date | The DRUG_EXPOSURE_END_DATE denotes the day the drug exposure ended for the patient. | If this information is not explicitly available in the data, infer the end date from start date and duration. For detailed conventions for how to populate this field, please see the [THEMIS repository](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/tag_drug_exposure.html). | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| drug_exposure_end_datetime |  | This is not required, though it is in v6. If a source does not specify datetime the convention is to set the time to midnight (00:00:0000) | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| verbatim_end_date | This is the end date of the drug exposure as it appears in the source data, if it is given | Put the end date or discontinuation date as it appears from the source data or leave blank if unavailable. | date | No | No | No |  |  |
| drug_type_concept_id | You can use the TYPE_CONCEPT_ID to delineate between prescriptions written vs. prescriptions dispensed vs. medication history vs. patient-reported exposure, etc. | Choose the drug_type_concept_id that best represents the provenance of the record, for example whether it came from a record of a prescription written or physician administered drug. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Type+Concept&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). A more detailed explanation of each Type Concept can be found on the [vocabulary wiki](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/Vocab.-TYPE_CONCEPT). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Type Concept |
| stop_reason | The reason a person stopped a medication as it is represented in the source. Reasons include regimen completed, changed, removed, etc. This field will be retired in v6.0. | This information is often not populated in source data and it is a valid etl choice to leave it blank if the information does not exist. | varchar(20) | No | No | No |  |  |
| refills | This is only filled in when the record is coming from a prescription written this field is meant to represent intended refills at time of the prescription. |  | integer | No | No | No |  |  |
| quantity |  | To find the dose form of a drug the RELATIONSHIP table can be used where the relationship_id is ‘Has dose form’. If liquid, quantity stands for the total amount dispensed or ordered of ingredient in the units given by the drug_strength table. If the unit from the source data does not align with the unit in the DRUG_STRENGTH table the quantity should be converted to the correct unit given in DRUG_STRENGTH. For clinical drugs with fixed dose forms (tablets etc.) the quantity is the number of units/tablets/capsules prescribed or dispensed (can be partial, but then only 1/2 or 1/3, not 0.01). Clinical drugs with divisible dose forms (injections) the quantity is the amount of ingredient the patient got. For example, if the injection is 2mg/mL but the patient got 80mL then quantity is reported as 160. Quantified clinical drugs with divisible dose forms (prefilled syringes), the quantity is the amount of ingredient similar to clinical drugs. Please see [how to calculate drug dose](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/drug_dose.html) for more information. | float | No | No | No |  |  |
| days_supply |  | The number of days of supply of the medication as recorded in the original prescription or dispensing record. Days supply can differ from actual drug duration (i.e. prescribed days supply vs actual exposure).”,“The field should be left empty if the source data does not contain a verbatim days_supply, and should not be calculated from other fields. Negative values are not allowed. If the source has negative days supply the record should be dropped as it is unknown if the patient actually took the drug. Several actions are possible: 1) record is not trustworthy and we remove the record entirely. 2) we trust the record and leave days_supply empty or 3) record needs to be combined with other record (e.g. reversal of prescription). High values (>365 days) should be investigated. If considered an error in the source data (e.g. typo), the value needs to be excluded to prevent creation of unrealistic long eras. | integer | No | No | No |  |  |
| sig | This is the verbatim instruction for the drug as written by the provider. | Put the written out instructions for the drug as it is verbatim in the source, if available. | varchar(MAX) | No | No | No |  |  |
| route_concept_id |  | The standard CONCEPT_ID that the ROUTE_SOURCE_VALUE maps to in the route domain. This is meant to represent the route of administration of the drug. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Route&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=) | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Route |
| lot_number |  |  | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| provider_id | The Provider associated with drug record, e.g. the provider who wrote the prescription or the provider who administered the drug. | The ETL may need to make a choice as to which PROVIDER_ID to put here. Based on what is available this may or may not be different than the provider associated with the overall VISIT_OCCURRENCE record, for example the ordering vs administering physician on an EHR record. | integer | No | No | Yes | PROVIDER |  |
| visit_occurrence_id | The Visit during which the drug was prescribed, administered or dispensed. | To populate this field drug exposures must be explicitly initiated in the visit. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_OCCURRENCE |  |
| visit_detail_id | The VISIT_DETAIL record during which the drug exposure occurred. For example, if the person was in the ICU at the time of the drug administration the VISIT_OCCURRENCE record would reflect the overall hospital stay and the VISIT_DETAIL record would reflect the ICU stay during the hospital visit. | Same rules apply as for the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_DETAIL |  |
| drug_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the drug exposure that occurred. For example, this could be an NDC or Gemscript code. | This code is mapped to a Standard Drug Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is stored here for reference. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| drug_source_concept_id | This is the concept representing the drug source value and may not necessarily be standard. This field is discouraged from use in analysis because it is not required to contain Standard Concepts that are used across the OHDSI community, and should only be used when Standard Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for the Drug necessary for a given analytic use case. Consider using DRUG_CONCEPT_ID instead to enable standardized analytics that can be consistent across the network. | If the DRUG_SOURCE_VALUE is coded in the source data using an OMOP supported vocabulary put the concept id representing the source value here. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| route_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the drug route. | This information may be called something different in the source data but the field is meant to contain a value indicating when and how a drug was given to a patient.

| dose_unit_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the dose unit of the drug given. | This information may be called something different in the source data but the field is meant to contain a value indicating the unit of dosage of drug given to the patient. **This is an older column and will be deprecated in an upcoming version.** | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |

### procedure_occurrence


**Table Description** 

This table contains records of activities or processes ordered by, or
carried out by, a healthcare provider on the patient with a diagnostic
or therapeutic purpose. 

**User Guide** 

Lab tests are not a procedure, if something is observed with an
expected resulting amount and unit then it should be a measurement.
Phlebotomy is a procedure but so trivial that it tends to be rarely
captured. It can be assumed that there is a phlebotomy procedure
associated with many lab tests, therefore it is unnecessary to add them
as separate procedures. 

**ETL Conventions** 

When dealing with duplicate records, the ETL must determine whether
to sum them up into one record or keep them separate. Things to consider
are: 
- Same Procedure
- Same procedure_datetime
- Same Visit Occurrence or Visit Detail
- Same Provider
- Same Modifier for Procedures.

Source codes and source text fields mapped to Standard Concepts of
the Procedure Domain have to be recorded here. 

| CDM Field | User Guide | ETL Conventions | Datatype | Required | Primary Key | Foreign Key | FK Table | FK Domain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| procedure_occurrence_id | The unique key given to a procedure record for a person. Refer to the ETL for how duplicate procedures during the same visit were handled. | Each instance of a procedure occurrence in the source data should be assigned this unique key. In some cases, a person can have multiple records of the same procedure within the same visit. It is valid to keep these duplicates and assign them individual, unique, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE_IDs, though it is up to the ETL how they should be handled. | integer | Yes | Yes | No |  |  |
| person_id | The PERSON_ID of the PERSON for whom the procedure is recorded. This may be a system generated code. |  | integer | Yes | No | Yes | PERSON |  |
| procedure_concept_id | The PROCEDURE_CONCEPT_ID field is recommended for primary use in analyses, and must be used for network studies. This is the standard concept mapped from the source value which represents a procedure | The CONCEPT_ID that the PROCEDURE_SOURCE_VALUE maps to. Only records whose source values map to standard concepts with a domain of “Procedure” should go in this table. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Procedure&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Procedure |
| procedure_date | Use this date to determine the date the procedure started. | This is meant to be the **start date** of the procedure. It will be renamed in a future version to **PROCEDURE_START_DATE**. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| procedure_datetime |  | If the procedure has a start time in the native date, use this field to house that information. This will be renamed in a future version to **PROCEDURE_START_DATETIME**. | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| procedure_end_date | Use this field to house the date that the procedure ended. | This is meant to be the end date of the procedure. It is not required and for most cases will be the same as the PROCEDURE_START_DATE. | date | No | No | No |  |  |
| procedure_end_datetime | Use this field to house the datetime that the procedure ended. | This is meant to house the end datetime of the procedure and will most often be used in conjunction with the procedure_start_datetime to determine the length of the procedure. | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| procedure_type_concept_id | This field can be used to determine the provenance of the Procedure record, as in whether the procedure was from an EHR system, insurance claim, registry, or other sources. | Choose the PROCEDURE_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID that best represents the provenance of the record, for example whether it came from an EHR record or billing claim. If a procedure is recorded as an EHR encounter, the PROCEDURE_TYPE_CONCEPT would be ‘EHR encounter record’. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Type+Concept&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). A more detailed explanation of each Type Concept can be found on the [vocabulary wiki](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/Vocab.-TYPE_CONCEPT). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Type Concept |
| modifier_concept_id | The modifiers are intended to give additional information about the procedure but as of now the vocabulary is under review. | It is up to the ETL to choose how to map modifiers if they exist in source data. These concepts are typically distinguished by ‘Modifier’ concept classes (e.g., ‘CPT4 Modifier’ as part of the ‘CPT4’ vocabulary). If there is more than one modifier on a record, one should be chosen that pertains to the procedure rather than provider. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?conceptClass=CPT4+Modifier&conceptClass=HCPCS+Modifier&vocabulary=CPT4&vocabulary=HCPCS&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |

### device_exposure


**Table Description** 

The Device domain captures information about a person’s exposure to a
foreign physical object or instrument which is used for diagnostic or
therapeutic purposes through a mechanism beyond chemical action. Devices
include implantable objects (e.g. pacemakers, stents, artificial
joints), medical equipment and supplies (e.g. bandages, crutches,
syringes), other instruments used in medical procedures (e.g. sutures,
defibrillators) and material used in clinical care (e.g. adhesives, body
material, dental material, surgical material). 

**User Guide** 

The distinction between Devices or supplies and Procedures are
sometimes blurry, but the former are physical objects while the latter
are actions, often to apply a Device or supply. 

**ETL Conventions** 

Source codes and source text fields mapped to Standard Concepts of
the Device Domain have to be recorded here. 

| CDM Field | User Guide | ETL Conventions | Datatype | Required | Primary Key | Foreign Key | FK Table | FK Domain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| device_exposure_id | The unique key given to records a person’s exposure to a foreign physical object or instrument. | Each instance of an exposure to a foreign object or device present in the source data should be assigned this unique key. | integer | Yes | Yes | No |  |  |
| person_id |  |  | integer | Yes | No | Yes | PERSON |  |
| device_concept_id | The DEVICE_CONCEPT_ID field is recommended for primary use in analyses, and must be used for network studies. This is the standard concept mapped from the source concept id which represents a foreign object or instrument the person was exposed to. | The CONCEPT_ID that the DEVICE_SOURCE_VALUE maps to. | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Device |
| device_exposure_start_date | Use this date to determine the start date of the device record. | Valid entries include a start date of a procedure to implant a device, the date of a prescription for a device, or the date of device administration. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| device_exposure_start_datetime |  | This is not required, though it is in v6. If a source does not specify datetime the convention is to set the time to midnight (00:00:0000) | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| device_exposure_end_date | The DEVICE_EXPOSURE_END_DATE denotes the day the device exposure ended for the patient, if given. | Put the end date or discontinuation date as it appears from the source data or leave blank if unavailable. | date | No | No | No |  |  |
| device_exposure_end_datetime |  | If a source does not specify datetime the convention is to set the time to midnight (00:00:0000) | datetime | No | No | No |  |  |
| device_type_concept_id | You can use the TYPE_CONCEPT_ID to denote the provenance of the record, as in whether the record is from administrative claims or EHR. | Choose the device_type_concept_id that best represents the provenance of the record. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Type+Concept&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). A more detailed explanation of each Type Concept can be found on the [vocabulary wiki](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/Vocab.-TYPE_CONCEPT). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Type Concept |
| unique_device_id | This is the Unique Device Identification (UDI-DI) number for devices regulated by the FDA, if given. | For medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, a Unique Device Identification (UDI) is provided if available in the data source and is recorded in the UNIQUE_DEVICE_ID field. | varchar(255) | No | No | No |  |  |
| production_id | This is the Production Identifier (UDI-PI) portion of the Unique Device Identification. |  | varchar(255) | No | No | No |  |  |
| quantity |  | If there is a record of device exposure in the source but no quantity value, then set to 1. | integer | No | No | No |  |  |
| provider_id | The Provider associated with device record, e.g. the provider who wrote the prescription or the provider who implanted the device. | The ETL may need to make a choice as to which PROVIDER_ID to put here. Based on what is available this may or may not be different than the provider associated with the overall VISIT_OCCURRENCE record. | integer | No | No | Yes | PROVIDER |  |
| visit_occurrence_id | The Visit during which the device was prescribed or given. | To populate this field device exposures must be explicitly initiated in the visit. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_OCCURRENCE |  |
| visit_detail_id | The Visit Detail during which the device was prescribed or given. | To populate this field device exposures must be explicitly initiated in the visit detail record. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_DETAIL |  |
| device_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the device exposure that occurred. For example, this could be an NDC or Gemscript code. | This code is mapped to a Standard Device Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is stored here for reference. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| device_source_concept_id | This is the concept representing the device source value and may not necessarily be standard. This field is discouraged from use in analysis because it is not required to contain Standard Concepts that are used across the OHDSI community, and should only be used when Standard Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for the Device necessary for a given analytic use case. Consider using DEVICE_CONCEPT_ID instead to enable standardized analytics that can be consistent across the network. | If the DEVICE_SOURCE_VALUE is coded in the source data using an OMOP supported vocabulary put the concept id representing the source value here. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| unit_concept_id | UNIT_SOURCE_VALUES should be mapped to a Standard Concept in the Unit domain that best represents the unit as given in the source data. | There is no standardization requirement for units associated with DEVICE_CONCEPT_IDs, however, it is the responsibility of the ETL to choose the most plausible unit. If the source unit is NULL (applicable to cases when there’s no numerical value or when it doesn’t require a unit), keep unit_concept_id NULL as well. If there’s no mapping of a source unit, populate unit_concept_id with 0. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Unit |
| unit_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the unit of the Device. For example, blood transfusions are considered devices and can be given in mL quantities. | This code is mapped to a Standard Condition Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is stored here for reference. Using the blood transfusion example, blood transfusion is represented by the DEVICE_CONCEPT_ID and the unit (mL) would be housed in the UNIT_SOURCE_VALUE and mapped to a standard concept in the unit domain. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| unit_source_concept_id | This is the concept representing the UNIT_SOURCE_VALUE and may not necessarily be standard. This field is discouraged from use in analysis because it is not required to contain Standard Concepts that are used across the OHDSI community, and should only be used when Standard Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for the Unit necessary for a given analytic use case. Consider using UNIT_CONCEPT_ID instead to enable standardized analytics that can be consistent across the network. | If the UNIT_SOURCE_VALUE is coded in the source data using an OMOP supported vocabulary put the concept id representing the source value here. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |

### measurement


**Table Description** 

The MEASUREMENT table contains records of Measurements,
i.e. structured values (numerical or categorical) obtained through
systematic and standardized examination or testing of a Person or
Person’s sample. The MEASUREMENT table contains both orders and results
of such Measurements as laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative
findings from pathology reports, etc. Measurements are stored as
attribute value pairs, with the attribute as the Measurement Concept and
the value representing the result. The value can be a Concept (stored in
VALUE_AS_CONCEPT), or a numerical value (VALUE_AS_NUMBER) with a Unit
(UNIT_CONCEPT_ID). The Procedure for obtaining the sample is housed in
the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table, though it is unnecessary to create a
PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE record for each measurement if one does not exist
in the source data. Measurements differ from Observations in that they
require a standardized test or some other activity to generate a
quantitative or qualitative result. If there is no result, it is assumed
that the lab test was conducted but the result was not captured. 

**User Guide** 

Measurements are predominately lab tests with a few exceptions, like
blood pressure or function tests. Results are given in the form of a
value and unit combination. When investigating measurements, look for
operator_concept_ids (<, >, etc.). 

**ETL Conventions** 

Only records where the source value maps to a Concept in the
measurement domain should be included in this table. Even though each
Measurement always has a result, the fields VALUE_AS_NUMBER and
VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID are not mandatory as often the result is not given
in the source data. When the result is not known, the Measurement record
represents just the fact that the corresponding Measurement was carried
out, which in itself is already useful information for some use cases.
For some Measurement Concepts, the result is included in the test. For
example, ICD10 CONCEPT_ID [45548980](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/45548980)
‘Abnormal level of unspecified serum enzyme’ indicates a Measurement and
the result (abnormal). In those situations, the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP
table in addition to the ‘Maps to’ record contains a second record with
the relationship_id set to ‘Maps to value’. In this example, the ‘Maps
to’ relationship directs to [4046263](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4046263)
‘Enzyme measurement’ as well as a ‘Maps to value’ record to [4135493](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4135493)
‘Abnormal’.

[Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Meas+Value+Operator&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). The operator_concept_id explictly refers to the value of the measurement. Leave it NULL if there’s an exact numeric value given (instead of putting ‘=’) or there’s no numeric value at all. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| value_as_number | This is the numerical value of the Result of the Measurement, if available. Note that measurements such as blood pressures will be split into their component parts i.e. one record for systolic, one record for diastolic. | [Convention for negative values](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/negative_value_as_number.html) | float | No | No | No |  |  |
| value_as_concept_id | If the raw data gives a categorial result for measurements those values are captured and mapped to standard concepts in the ‘Meas Value’ domain. | If there is no categorial result in the source data, set VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID to NULL, if there is a categorial result in a source data but without mapping, set VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID to 0, else map to a CONCEPT_ID. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| unit_concept_id | At present, there isn’t a prescribed unit for individual measurements, such as Hemoglobin A1C, meaning it’s not obligatory to express these measurements as a percentage. UNIT_SOURCE_VALUES should be linked to a Standard Concept within the Unit domain that most accurately reflects the unit provided in the source data. | If the source data does not include units, set UNIT_CONCEPT_ID to NULL. If units are provided but not mapped, set UNIT_CONCEPT_ID to 0. Otherwise, map the units to a CONCEPT_ID. Remember that units are case-sensitive in vocabulary. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Unit |
| range_low | Ranges have the same unit as the VALUE_AS_NUMBER. These ranges are provided by the source and should remain NULL if not given. | If reference ranges for upper and lower limit of normal as provided (typically by a laboratory) these are stored in the RANGE_HIGH and RANGE_LOW fields. This should be set to NULL if not provided. | float | No | No | No |  |  |

For example the admitting vs attending physician on an EHR record. | integer | No | No | Yes | PROVIDER |  |
| visit_occurrence_id | The visit during which the Measurement occurred. | Depending on the structure of the source data, this may have to be determined based on dates. If a MEASUREMENT_DATE occurs within the start and end date of a Visit it is a valid ETL choice to choose the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID from the visit that subsumes it, even if not explicitly stated in the data. While not required, an attempt should be made to locate the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID of the measurement record. If a measurement is related to a visit explicitly in the source data, it is possible that the result date of the Measurement falls outside of the bounds of the Visit dates. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_OCCURRENCE |  |
| visit_detail_id | The VISIT_DETAIL record during which the Measurement occurred. For example, if the Person was in the ICU at the time the VISIT_OCCURRENCE record would reflect the overall hospital stay and the VISIT_DETAIL record would reflect the ICU stay during the hospital visit. | Same rules apply as for the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_DETAIL |  |

### observation


**Table Description** 

The OBSERVATION table captures clinical facts about a Person obtained
in the context of examination, questioning or a procedure. Any data that
cannot be represented by any other domains, such as social and lifestyle
facts, medical history, family history, etc. are recorded here. 

**User Guide** 

Observations differ from Measurements in that they do not require a
standardized test or some other activity to generate clinical fact.
Typical observations are medical history, family history, the stated
need for certain treatment, social circumstances, lifestyle choices,
healthcare utilization patterns, etc. If the generation clinical facts
requires a standardized testing such as lab testing or imaging and leads
to a standardized result, the data item is recorded in the MEASUREMENT
table. If the clinical fact observed determines a sign, symptom,
diagnosis of a disease or other medical condition, it is recorded in the
CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table. Valid Observation Concepts are not enforced
to be from any domain but they must not belong to the Condition,
Procedure, Drug, Device, Specimen, or Measurement domains and they must
be Standard Concepts.   
  
The observation table usually records the
date or datetime of when the observation was obtained, not the date of
the observation starting. For example, if the patient reports that they
had a heart attack when they were 50, the observation date or datetime
is the date of the report, the heart attack observation can have a
value_as_concept which captures how long ago the observation applied to
the patient. 

**ETL Conventions** 

Records whose Source Values map to any domain besides Condition,
Procedure, Drug, Specimen, Measurement or Device should be stored in the
Observation table. Observations can be stored as attribute value pairs,
with the attribute as the Observation Concept and the value representing
the clinical fact. This fact can be a Concept (stored in
VALUE_AS_CONCEPT), a numerical value (VALUE_AS_NUMBER) or a verbatim
string (VALUE_AS_STRING). Even though Observations do not have an
explicit result, the clinical fact can be stated separately from the
type of Observation in the VALUE_AS_* fields. It is recommended for
Observations that are suggestive statements of positive assertion should
have a value of ‘Yes’ (concept_id=4188539), recorded, even though the
null value is the equivalent.

| observation_type_concept_id | This field can be used to determine the provenance of the Observation record, as in whether the measurement was from an EHR system, insurance claim, registry, or other sources. | Choose the OBSERVATION_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID that best represents the provenance of the record, for example whether it came from an EHR record or billing claim. [Accepted Concepts](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms?domain=Type+Concept&standardConcept=Standard&page=1&pageSize=15&query=). A more detailed explanation of each Type Concept can be found on the [vocabulary wiki](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/Vocab.-TYPE_CONCEPT). | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Type Concept |
| value_as_number | This is the numerical value of the Result of the Observation, if applicable and available. It is not expected that all Observations will have numeric results, rather, this field is here to house values should they exist. |  | float | No | No | No |  |  |
| value_as_string | This is the categorical value of the Result of the Observation, if applicable and available. |  | varchar(60) | No | No | No |  |  |
| value_as_concept_id | It is possible that some records destined for the Observation table have two clinical ideas represented in one source code. This is common with ICD10 codes that describe a family history of some Condition, for example. In OMOP the Vocabulary breaks these two clinical ideas into two codes; one becomes the OBSERVATION_CONCEPT_ID and the other becomes the VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID. It is important when using the Observation table to keep this possibility in mind and to examine the VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID field for relevant information. | Note that the value of VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID may be provided through mapping from a source Concept which contains the content of the Observation. In those situations, the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table in addition to the ‘Maps to’ record contains a second record with the relationship_id set to ‘Maps to value’. For example, ICD10 [Z82.4](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/45581076) ‘Family history of ischaemic heart disease and other diseases of the circulatory system’ has a ‘Maps to’ relationship to [4167217](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4167217) ‘Family history of clinical finding’ as well as a ‘Maps to value’ record to [134057](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/134057) ‘Disorder of cardiovascular system’. If there’s no categorial result in a source_data, set value_as_concept_id to NULL, if there is a categorial result in a source_data but without mapping, set value_as_concept_id to 0. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| qualifier_concept_id | This field contains all attributes specifying the clinical fact further, such as as degrees, severities, drug-drug interaction alerts etc. | Use your best judgement as to what Concepts to use here and if they are necessary to accurately represent the clinical record. There is no restriction on the domain of these Concepts, they just need to be Standard. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| unit_concept_id | There is currently no recommended unit for individual observation concepts. UNIT_SOURCE_VALUES should be mapped to a Standard Concept in the Unit domain that best represents the unit as given in the source data. | There is no standardization requirement for units associated with OBSERVATION_CONCEPT_IDs, however, it is the responsibility of the ETL to choose the most plausible unit. If the source unit is NULL (applicable to cases when there’s no numerical value or when it doesn’t require a unit), keep unit_concept_id NULL as well. If there’s no mapping of a source unit, populate unit_concept_id with 0. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Unit |
| provider_id | The provider associated with the observation record, e.g. the provider who ordered the test or the provider who recorded the result. | The ETL may need to make a choice as to which PROVIDER_ID to put here. Based on what is available this may or may not be different than the provider associated with the overall VISIT_OCCURRENCE record. For example the admitting vs attending physician on an EHR record. | integer | No | No | Yes | PROVIDER |  |
| visit_occurrence_id | The visit during which the Observation occurred. | Depending on the structure of the source data, this may have to be determined based on dates. If an OBSERVATION_DATE occurs within the start and end date of a Visit it is a valid ETL choice to choose the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID from the visit that subsumes it, even if not explicitly stated in the data. While not required, an attempt should be made to locate the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID of the observation record. If an observation is related to a visit explicitly in the source data, it is possible that the result date of the Observation falls outside of the bounds of the Visit dates. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_OCCURRENCE |  |
| visit_detail_id | The VISIT_DETAIL record during which the Observation occurred. For example, if the Person was in the ICU at the time the VISIT_OCCURRENCE record would reflect the overall hospital stay and the VISIT_DETAIL record would reflect the ICU stay during the hospital visit. | Same rules apply as for the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID. | integer | No | No | Yes | VISIT_DETAIL |  |
| observation_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the Observation that occurred. For example, this could be an ICD10 or Read code. | This code is mapped to a Standard Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is stored here for reference. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| observation_source_concept_id | This is the concept representing the OBSERVATION_SOURCE_VALUE and may not necessarily be standard. This field is discouraged from use in analysis because it is not required to contain Standard Concepts that are used across the OHDSI community, and should only be used when Standard Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for the Observation necessary for a given analytic use case. Consider using OBSERVATION_CONCEPT_ID instead to enable standardized analytics that can be consistent across the network. | If the OBSERVATION_SOURCE_VALUE is coded in the source data using an OMOP supported vocabulary put the concept id representing the source value here. | integer | No | No | Yes | CONCEPT |  |
| unit_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the unit of the Observation that occurred. | This code is mapped to a Standard Condition Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is stored here for reference. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| qualifier_source_value | This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the qualifier of the Observation that occurred. | This code is mapped to a Standard Condition Concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is stored here for reference. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| value_source_value | This field houses the verbatim result value of the Observation from the source data. Do not get confused with the Observation_source_value which captures source value of the observation mapped to observation_concept_id. This field is the observation result value from the source. | If the observation_source_value was a question, for example, or an observation that requires a result then this field is the answer/ result from the source data. Store the verbatim value that represents the result of the observation_source_value. | varchar(50) | No | No | No |  |  |
| observation_event_id | If the Observation record is related to another record in the database, this field is the primary key of the linked record. | Put the primary key of the linked record, if applicable, here. See the [ETL Conventions for the OBSERVATION](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#observation) table for more details. | integer | No | No | No |  |  |

### note


**Table Description** 

The NOTE table captures unstructured information that was recorded by
a provider about a patient in free text (in ASCII, or preferably in UTF8
format) notes on a given date. The type of note_text is CLOB or
varchar(MAX) depending on RDBMS. 

**User Guide** 

NA 

**ETL Conventions** 

HL7/LOINC CDO is a standard for consistent naming of documents to
support a range of use cases: retrieval, organization, display, and
exchange. It guides the creation of LOINC codes for clinical notes. CDO
annotates each document with 5 dimensions: 
- **Kind of Document**: Characterizes the general
structure of the document at a macro level (e.g. Anesthesia
Consent)
- **Type of Service**: Characterizes the kind of service
or activity (e.g. evaluations, consultations, and summaries). The notion
of time sequence, e.g., at the beginning (admission) at the end
(discharge) is subsumed in this axis. Example: Discharge Teaching.
- **Setting**: Setting is an extension of CMS’s
definitions (e.g. Inpatient, Outpatient)
- **Subject Matter Domain (SMD)**: Characterizes the
subject matter domain of a note (e.g. Anesthesiology)
- **Role**: Characterizes the training or professional
level of the author of the document, but does not break down to
specialty or subspecialty (e.g. Physician) Each combination of these 5
dimensions rolls up to a unique LOINC code.

According to CDO requirements, only 2 of the 5 dimensions are
required to properly annotate a document; Kind of Document and any one
of the other 4 dimensions. However, not all the permutations of the CDO
dimensions will necessarily yield an existing LOINC code. Each of these
dimensions are contained in the OMOP Vocabulary under the domain of
‘Meas Value’ with each dimension represented as a Concept Class.

### location


**Table Description** 

The LOCATION table represents a generic way to capture physical
location or address information of Persons and Care Sites. 

**User Guide** 

The current iteration of the LOCATION table is US centric. Until a
major release to correct this, certain fields can be used to represent
different international values.   
  
 - STATE can also be used for
province or district  
- ZIP is also the postal code or postcode   
-
COUNTY can also be used to represent region 

**ETL Conventions** 

Each address or Location is unique and is present only once in the
table. Locations do not contain names, such as the name of a hospital.
In order to construct a full address that can be used in the postal
service, the address information from the Location needs to be combined
with information from the Care Site.

### care_site


**Table Description** 

The CARE_SITE table contains a list of uniquely identified
institutional (physical or organizational) units where healthcare
delivery is practiced (offices, wards, hospitals, clinics, etc.). 

**User Guide** 

NA 

**ETL Conventions** 

Care site is a unique combination of location_id and nature of the
site - the latter could be the place of service, name, or another
characteristic in your source data. Care site does not take into account
the provider (human) information such a specialty. Many source data do
not make a distinction between individual and institutional providers.
The CARE_SITE table contains the institutional providers. If the source,
instead of uniquely identifying individual Care Sites, only provides
limited information such as Place of Service, generic or “pooled” Care
Site records are listed in the CARE_SITE table. There can be
hierarchical and business relationships between Care Sites. For example,
wards can belong to clinics or departments, which can in turn belong to
hospitals, which in turn can belong to hospital systems, which in turn
can belong to HMOs.The relationships between Care Sites are defined in
the FACT_RELATIONSHIP table.

### provider


**Table Description** 

The PROVIDER table contains a list of uniquely identified healthcare
providers; duplication is not allowed. These are individuals providing
hands-on healthcare to patients, such as physicians, nurses, midwives,
physical therapists etc. 

**User Guide** 

Many sources do not make a distinction between individual and
institutional providers. The PROVIDER table contains the individual
providers. If the source only provides limited information such as
specialty instead of uniquely identifying individual providers, generic
or ‘pooled’ Provider records are listed in the PROVIDER table.

### payer_plan_period


**Table Description** 

The PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD table captures details of the period of time
that a Person is continuously enrolled under a specific health Plan
benefit structure from a given Payer. Each Person receiving healthcare
is typically covered by a health benefit plan, which pays for (fully or
partially), or directly provides, the care. These benefit plans are
provided by payers, such as health insurances or state or government
agencies. In each plan the details of the health benefits are defined
for the Person or her family, and the health benefit Plan might change
over time typically with increasing utilization (reaching certain cost
thresholds such as deductibles), plan availability and purchasing
choices of the Person. The unique combinations of Payer organizations,
health benefit Plans and time periods in which they are valid for a
Person are recorded in this table. 

**User Guide** 

A Person can have multiple, overlapping, Payer_Plan_Periods in this
table. For example, medical and drug coverage in the US can be
represented by two Payer_Plan_Periods. The details of the benefit
structure of the Plan is rarely known, the idea is just to identify that
the Plans are different.

### cost


**Table Description** 

The COST table captures records containing the cost of any medical
event recorded in one of the OMOP clinical event tables such as
DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, VISIT_OCCURRENCE, VISIT_DETAIL,
DEVICE_OCCURRENCE, OBSERVATION or MEASUREMENT. 

Each record in the cost table account for the amount of money
transacted for the clinical event. So, the COST table may be used to
represent both receivables (charges) and payments (paid), each
transaction type represented by its COST_CONCEPT_ID. The
COST_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID field will use concepts in the Standardized
Vocabularies to designate the source (provenance) of the cost data. A
reference to the health plan information in the PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD table
is stored in the record for information used for the adjudication system
to determine the persons benefit for the clinical event. 

**User Guide** 

When dealing with summary costs, the cost of the goods or services
the provider provides is often not known directly, but derived from the
hospital charges multiplied by an average cost-to-charge ratio. 

**ETL Conventions** 

One cost record is generated for each response by a payer. In a
claims databases, the payment and payment terms reported by the payer
for the goods or services billed will generate one cost record. If the
source data has payment information for more than one payer
(i.e. primary insurance and secondary insurance payment for one entity),
then a cost record is created for each reporting payer. Therefore, it is
possible for one procedure to have multiple cost records for each payer,
but typically it contains one or no record per entity. Payer
reimbursement cost records will be identified by using the PAYER_PLAN_ID
field. Drug costs are composed of ingredient cost (the amount charged by
the wholesale distributor or manufacturer), the dispensing fee (the
amount charged by the pharmacy and the sales tax).

### drug_era


**Table Description** 

A Drug Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is assumed to
be exposed to a particular active ingredient. A Drug Era is not the same
as a Drug Exposure: Exposures are individual records corresponding to
the source when Drug was delivered to the Person, while successive
periods of Drug Exposures are combined under certain rules to produce
continuous Drug Eras. Every record in the DRUG_EXPOSURE table should be
part of a drug era based on the dates of exposure. 

**User Guide** 

NA 

**ETL Conventions** 

The SQL script for generating DRUG_ERA records can be found [here](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/sqlScripts.html#drug_eras).

| drug_era_id |  |  | integer | Yes | Yes | No |  |  |
| person_id |  |  | integer | Yes | No | Yes | PERSON |  |
| drug_concept_id | The drug_concept_id should conform to the concept class ‘ingredient’ as the drug_era is an era of time where a person is exposed to a particular drug ingredient. |  | integer | Yes | No | Yes | CONCEPT | Drug |
| drug_era_start_date |  | The Drug Era Start Date is the start date of the first Drug Exposure for a given ingredient, with at least 31 days since the previous exposure. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| drug_era_end_date |  | The Drug Era End Date is the end date of the last Drug Exposure. The End Date of each Drug Exposure is either taken from the field drug_exposure_end_date or, as it is typically not available, inferred using the following rules: For pharmacy prescription data, the date when the drug was dispensed plus the number of days of supply are used to extrapolate the End Date for the Drug Exposure. Depending on the country-specific healthcare system, this supply information is either explicitly provided in the day_supply field or inferred from package size or similar information. For Procedure Drugs, usually the drug is administered on a single date (i.e., the administration date). A standard Persistence Window of 30 days (gap, slack) is permitted between two subsequent such extrapolated DRUG_EXPOSURE records to be considered to be merged into a single Drug Era. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| drug_exposure_count | The count of grouped DRUG_EXPOSURE records that were included in the DRUG_ERA row |  | integer | No | No | No |  |  |
| gap_days |  | The Gap Days determine how many total drug-free days are observed between all Drug Exposure events that contribute to a DRUG_ERA record. It is assumed that the drugs are “not stockpiled” by the patient, i.e. that if a new drug prescription or refill is observed (a new DRUG_EXPOSURE record is written), the remaining supply from the previous events is abandoned. The difference between Persistence Window and Gap Days is that the former is the maximum drug-free time allowed between two subsequent DRUG_EXPOSURE records, while the latter is the sum of actual drug-free days for the given Drug Era under the above assumption of non-stockpiling. | integer | No | No | No |  |  |

### dose_era


**Table Description** 

A Dose Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is assumed to
be exposed to a constant dose of a specific active ingredient. 

**User Guide** 

NA 

**ETL Conventions** 

Dose Eras will be derived from records in the DRUG_EXPOSURE table and
the Dose information from the DRUG_STRENGTH table using a standardized
algorithm. Dose Form information is not taken into account. So, if the
patient changes between different formulations, or different
manufacturers with the same formulation, the Dose Era is still spanning
the entire time of exposure to the Ingredient.

| dose_era_end_date |  | The date the Person was no longer exposed to the dosage of the specific drug ingredient. An era is ended if there are 31 days or more between dosage records. | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |

### condition_era


**Table Description** 

A Condition Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is
assumed to have a given condition. Similar to Drug Eras, Condition Eras
are chronological periods of Condition Occurrence and every Condition
Occurrence record should be part of a Condition Era. Combining
individual Condition Occurrences into a single Condition Era serves two
purposes: 
- It allows aggregation of chronic conditions that require frequent
ongoing care, instead of treating each Condition Occurrence as an
independent event.
- It allows aggregation of multiple, closely timed doctor visits for
the same Condition to avoid double-counting the Condition Occurrences.
For example, consider a Person who visits her Primary Care Physician
(PCP) and who is referred to a specialist. At a later time, the Person
visits the specialist, who confirms the PCP’s original diagnosis and
provides the appropriate treatment to resolve the condition. These two
independent doctor visits should be aggregated into one Condition
Era.

**User Guide** 

NA 

**ETL Conventions** 

Each Condition Era corresponds to one or many Condition Occurrence
records that form a continuous interval. The condition_concept_id field
contains Concepts that are identical to those of the
CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table records that make up the Condition Era. In
contrast to Drug Eras, Condition Eras are not aggregated to contain
Conditions of different hierarchical layers. The SQl Script for
generating CONDITION_ERA records can be found [here](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/sqlScripts.html#condition_eras)
The Condition Era Start Date is the start date of the first Condition
Occurrence. The Condition Era End Date is the end date of the last
Condition Occurrence. Condition Eras are built with a Persistence Window
of 30 days, meaning, if no occurrence of the same condition_concept_id
happens within 30 days of any one occurrence, it will be considered the
condition_era_end_date.

| condition_era_end_date | The end date for the Condition Era constructed from the individual instances of Condition Occurrences. It is the end date of the final continuously recorded instance of the Condition. |  | date | Yes | No | No |  |  |
| condition_occurrence_count | The number of individual Condition Occurrences used to construct the condition era. |  | integer | No | No | No |  |  |

### episode


**Table Description** 

The EPISODE table aggregates lower-level clinical events
(VISIT_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, DEVICE_EXPOSURE)
into a higher-level abstraction representing clinically and analytically
relevant disease phases,outcomes and treatments. The EPISODE_EVENT table
connects qualifying clinical events (VISIT_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE,
PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, DEVICE_EXPOSURE) to the appropriate EPISODE entry.
For example cancers including their development over time, their
treatment, and final resolution. 

**User Guide** 

Valid Episode Concepts belong to the ‘Episode’ domain. For cancer
episodes please see [article], for non-cancer episodes please see
[article]. If your source data does not have all episodes that are
relevant to the therapeutic area, write only those you can easily derive
from the data. It is understood that that table is not currently

### concept


**Table Description** 

The Standardized Vocabularies contains records, or Concepts, that
uniquely identify each fundamental unit of meaning used to express
clinical information in all domain tables of the CDM. Concepts are
derived from vocabularies, which represent clinical information across a
domain (e.g. conditions, drugs, procedures) through the use of codes and
associated descriptions. Some Concepts are designated Standard Concepts,
meaning these Concepts can be used as normative expressions of a
clinical entity within the OMOP Common Data Model and standardized
analytics. Each Standard Concept belongs to one Domain, which defines
the location where the Concept would be expected to occur within the
data tables of the CDM. Concepts can represent broad categories
(‘Cardiovascular disease’), detailed clinical elements (‘Myocardial
infarction of the anterolateral wall’), or modifying characteristics and
attributes that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity of
a disease, associated morphology, etc.). Records in the Standardized
Vocabularies tables are derived from national or international
vocabularies such as SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and LOINC, or custom OMOP
Concepts defined to cover various aspects of observational data
analysis. 

**User Guide** 

The primary purpose of the CONCEPT table is to provide a standardized
representation of medical Concepts, allowing for consistent querying and
analysis across the healthcare databases. Users can join the CONCEPT
table with other tables in the CDM to enrich clinical data with
standardized Concept information or use the CONCEPT table as a reference
for mapping clinical data from source terminologies to Standard
Concepts.

### domain


**Table Description** 

The DOMAIN table includes a list of OMOP-defined Domains to which the
Concepts of the Standardized Vocabularies can belong. A Domain
represents a clinical definition whereby we assign matching Concepts for
the standardized fields in the CDM tables. For example, the Condition
Domain contains Concepts that describe a patient condition, and these
Concepts can only be used in the condition_concept_id field of the
CONDITION_OCCURRENCE and CONDITION_ERA tables. This reference table is
populated with a single record for each Domain, including a Domain ID
and a descriptive name for every Domain. 

**User Guide** 

Users can leverage the DOMAIN table to explore the full spectrum of
health-related data Domains available in the Standardized Vocabularies.

so-called horizontal (e.g. MedDRA, RxNorm) or vertical levels
(e.g. SNOMED) of the vocabulary structure. Vocabularies without any
Concept Classes, such as HCPCS, use the vocabulary_id as the Concept
Class. This reference table is populated with a single record for each
Concept Class, which includes a Concept Class ID and a fully specified
Concept Class name.

### concept_ancestor


**Table Description** 

The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table is designed to simplify observational
analysis by providing the complete hierarchical relationships between
Concepts. Only direct parent-child relationships between Concepts are
stored in the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table. To determine higher-level
ancestry connections, all individual direct relationships would have to
be navigated at analysis time. The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table includes
records for all parent-child relationships, as well as
grandparent-grandchild relationships and those of any other level of
lineage for Standard or Classification concepts. Using the
CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table allows for querying for all descendants of a
hierarchical concept, and the other way around. For example, drug
ingredients and drug products, beneath them in the hierarchy, are all
descendants of a drug class ancestor. This table is entirely derived
from the CONCEPT, CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP, and RELATIONSHIP tables. 

**User Guide** 

The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table can be used to explore the hierarchical
relationships captured in the table to gain insights into the
hierarchical structure of clinical concepts. Understanding the
hierarchical relationships of concepts can facilitate accurate
interpretation and analysis of healthcare data. Also, by incorporating
hierarchical relationships from the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table, users can
create cohorts containing related concepts within a hierarchical
structure, enabling more comprehensive cohort definitions.

### source_to_concept_map


**Table Description** 

The source to concept map table is recommended for use in ETL
processes to maintain local source codes which are not available as
Concepts in the Standardized Vocabularies, and to establish mappings for
each source code into a Standard Concept as target_concept_ids that can
be used to populate the Common Data Model tables. The
SOURCE_TO_CONCEPT_MAP table is no longer populated with content within
the Standardized Vocabularies published to the OMOP community.
**There are OHDSI tools to help you populate this table; [Usagi](https://github.com/OHDSI/Usagi) and [Perseus](https://github.com/ohdsi/Perseus). You can read more
about OMOP vocabulary mapping in [The

### cohort


**Table Description** 

The subject of a cohort can have multiple, discrete records in the
cohort table per cohort_definition_id, subject_id, and non-overlapping
time periods. The definition of the cohort is contained within the
COHORT_DEFINITION table. It is listed as part of the RESULTS schema
because it is a table that users of the database as well as tools such
as ATLAS need to be able to write to. The CDM and Vocabulary tables are
all read-only so it is suggested that the COHORT and COHORT_DEFINTION
tables are kept in a separate schema to alleviate confusion. 

**User Guide** 

NA 

**ETL Conventions** 

Cohorts typically include patients diagnosed with a specific
condition, patients exposed to a particular drug, but can also be
Providers who have performed a specific Procedure. Cohort records must
have a Start Date and an End Date, but the End Date may be set to Start
Date or could have an applied censor date using the Observation Period
Start Date. Cohort records must contain a Subject Id, which can refer to
the Person, Provider, Visit record or Care Site though they are most
often Person Ids. The Cohort Definition will define the type of subject
through the subject concept id. A subject can belong (or not belong) to
a cohort at any moment in time. A subject can only have one record in
the cohort table for any moment of time, i.e. it is not possible for a
person to contain multiple records indicating cohort membership that are
overlapping in time

### cohort_definition


**Table Description** 

The COHORT_DEFINITION table contains records defining a Cohort
derived from the data through the associated description and syntax and
upon instantiation (execution of the algorithm) placed into the COHORT
table. Cohorts are a set of subjects that satisfy a given combination of
inclusion criteria for a duration of time. The COHORT_DEFINITION table
provides a standardized structure for maintaining the rules governing
the inclusion of a subject into a cohort, and can store operational
programming code to instantiate the cohort within the OMOP Common Data
Model.
